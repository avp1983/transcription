 female/native hello i was surprised to hear that i'm very [hesitation] my score is i'm very happy with ideal boilers i need to reiterate i'm very happy with the response i received from both steve skinner and the lady who called me back cath i believe her name is who arranged an appointment sadly [hesitation] i'm going to have to wait two or three days for the appointment i had hoped as per steve's [hesitation] suggestion that it would be already tomorrow [hesitation] what i'm very disappointed with is with my combi [hesitation] ideal boiler there's a very serious design fault in this boiler because the heat exchanger is continuously getting [hestitation] particles and [hesitation] stopping [hesitation] my hot water i have had the system power flushed twice [hesitation] at my own expense when the heat exchanger again became slightly blocked [hesitation] although it's very little particles that are causing the blockage it does mean that the entire hot water shuts down so the plumbing people the independent plumbing people who i paid to flush the system came out again and flushed the system one more time free of charge so it can't be the power flush or [breath_mouth_noise] lack of power flush it's obviously a design fault in that particular boiler itself [hesitation] i would much appreciate somebody who understands this problem to call me to try and [hesitation] i need some assurance this is not going to be continually happening so far it is the fourth time my number is zero seven nine one nine two hundred six three eight i'm going to now give you the exact boiler model number and name so that you can look this up and please ask your manufacturing department what on earth is going on i have an ideal logic plus combi twenty four as i say i've had problems with hot water heat exchange now for the fifth time i said fourth because [hesitation] after the first time i had the whole system power flushed i had never expected this to occur again [hesitation] which is coming up to what five times in nineteen months ? totally unacceptable please could somebody call me ? [hesitation] i know that i still have a warranty on my boiler i feel this issue is so serious that i have the absolute right to request a new boiler to be fitted [hesitation] i can't continually have this

 [hesitation] it needs to be made a little more clear that on your survey that you actually need to press buttons one through to five rather than [hesitation] being a spoken prompt i know there are some surveys where voice is [hesitation] what is required it took me a few attempts before i realised you actually wanted me to prompt by pushing a button on my telephone keypad perhaps you need to make that a little bit more clear if you want people not to be exasperated and to continue with the survey

 [breath_mouth_noise] hello i'd like to make a complaint about the technical support within your shops [breath_mouth_noise] due to lack of product knowledge i have actually [breath_mouth_noise] put on wood stain without putting down a clear coat first which [hesitation] the i've now been informed i should have done and now i've got a bright orange floor and now i'm going to have to go back re-sand the floor [breath_mouth_noise] and re-paint all of my floor so the shop in hand was actually the chapel ash [breath_mouth_noise] shop in wolverhampton the dulux [breath_mouth_noise] decorating shop okay thank you bye (no relevant speech)

 right [hesitation] the problem is i'm using componex wr in a soft wood where unpainted it's a good colour match having applied hls stain [breath_mouth_noise] the there's a large colour difference between what was originally a good colour match and the [hesitation] stained match between the [hesitation] componex wr filler and the soft wood i'm very dissatisfied with the product componex wr because of this problem and the only solution i've been given is to rip it out and put something else in that is totally unsatisfactory as a product my number is oh one four nine four five six three nine three seven [breath_mouth_noise] thank you bye [hesitation]

 yes the only complaint i have and this is a big one really [breath_mouth_noise] is that your telephone service when you dial the number the original number [breath_mouth_noise] you don't actually get to speak to anybody you have to go through like seemingly endless options which never end in anybody answering the phone to the end result where there are two options neither of which [hesitation] will get anybody to answer the phone so [breath_mouth_noise] basically you have to go through and i believe it was the second option where you actually eventually get to speak to somebody but that took me a long time and i don't think i'm that stupid [breath_mouth_noise] i have been buying (()) and hammerite products for about thirty or forty years [breath_mouth_noise] thank you bye male/native

 [breath_mouth_noise] i purchased by dulux and glidden paints from the dulux trade centre in shrewsbury dixons of shrewsbury [breath_mouth_noise] and i was extremely impressed with the knowledge [breath_mouth_noise] of the salesman who dealt with me on saturday morning his knowledge of the dulux range was absolutely fantastic i was quite in awe of him and having been a salesman for fifty years i know just how difficult it is to do that [hesitation] i was that impressed that i have in fact send an email to the managing director of dixons congratulating him on his staff [breath_mouth_noise] so yes i'm extremely pleased with my experience with [breath_mouth_noise] dulux thank you male/native [breath_mouth_noise]

 hello yes the reason i rang up for i bought a dulux once [hesitation] and the problem is that it's been on the wall for four days there's a little mark on the wall went to wipe it off and [hesitation] it went straight back to the original colour just three or four little wipes on the mark and [hesitation] took all the paint off and i explained to the gentleman [hesitation] farrukh [hesitation] and he said [hesitation] he's not quite sure whether or not it's a fault or it's part and parcel of the [breath_mouth_noise] design of this paint well if it is i suggest that you do put quite boldly on the tins cannot be wiped at all [breath_mouth_noise] i'm not talking about scrubbing i'm just talking about a slight wipe with a tissue but i'm sending a sample in to be analysed so hopefully (()) thank you

 [breath_mouth_noise] now when i went into b&q and the local store asking about[hesitation] getting masonry paint mixed into a dark green for me no one was able to help me and nobody seemed to know how to resolve the situation [breath_mouth_noise] having phoned your firm they were most helpful and now tell me that i can get paint mixed [breath_mouth_noise] at a firm ie travis perkins but the other stores didn't seem to know this had i not phoned you i would have not known how to go about getting the colour paint i wanted [breath_mouth_noise] so perhaps this information could be made more widely known so that other people can take you know advantage of the service [breath_mouth_noise] otherwise everything has been fine thank
