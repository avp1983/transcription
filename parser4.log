 female/native hello i was surprised to hear that i'm very [hesitation] my score is i'm very happy with ideal boilers i need to reiterate i'm very happy with the response i received from both steve skinner and the lady who called me back cath i believe her name is who arranged an appointment sadly [hesitation] i'm going to have to wait two or three days for the appointment i had hoped as per steve's [hesitation] suggestion that it would be already tomorrow [hesitation] what i'm very disappointed with is with my combi [hesitation] ideal boiler there's a very serious design fault in this boiler because the heat exchanger is continuously getting [hestitation] particles and [hesitation] stopping [hesitation] my hot water i have had the system power flushed twice [hesitation] at my own expense when the heat exchanger again became slightly blocked [hesitation] although it's very little particles that are causing the blockage it does mean that the entire hot water shuts down so the plumbing people the independent plumbing people who i paid to flush the system came out again and flushed the system one more time free of charge so it can't be the power flush or [breath_mouth_noise] lack of power flush it's obviously a design fault in that particular boiler itself [hesitation] i would much appreciate somebody who understands this problem to call me to try and [hesitation] i need some assurance this is not going to be continually happening so far it is the fourth time my number is zero seven nine one nine two hundred six three eight i'm going to now give you the exact boiler model number and name so that you can look this up and please ask your manufacturing department what on earth is going on i have an ideal logic plus combi twenty four as i say i've had problems with hot water heat exchange now for the fifth time i said fourth because [hesitation] after the first time i had the whole system power flushed i had never expected this to occur again [hesitation] which is coming up to what five times in nineteen months ? totally unacceptable please could somebody call me ? [hesitation] i know that i still have a warranty on my boiler i feel this issue is so serious that i have the absolute right to request a new boiler to be fitted [hesitation] i can't continually have this

 [hesitation] it needs to be made a little more clear that on your survey that you actually need to press buttons one through to five rather than [hesitation] being a spoken prompt i know there are some surveys where voice is [hesitation] what is required it took me a few attempts before i realised you actually wanted me to prompt by pushing a button on my telephone keypad perhaps you need to make that a little bit more clear if you want people not to be exasperated and to continue with the survey
